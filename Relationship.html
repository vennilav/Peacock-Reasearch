        <p>Technically, only males are peacocks. Females are peahens, and together, they are called peafowl . Suitable males may gather harems of several females, each of which will lay three to five eggs. In fact, wild peafowl often roost in forest trees and gather in groups called parties.</p>
        <h3>Avoid Inbreeding</h3>
<p>You may need to buy your peafowl from separate breeders to avoid inbreeding. This is an issue particularly common in backyard farms. Good breeders, on the other hand, have meticulous records and organize their stock in such a way as to avoid unintentional breeding.</p>

<p>If you’re purchasing both a female and a male from a breeder, make sure you ask to see the records! It’s fine to have two peahens that are sisters or a mother-daughter duo, as long as your peacock is unrelated. Even so, aim for genetic diversity!</p> </body>
